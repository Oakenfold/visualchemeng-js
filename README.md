# About
JavaScript, HTML and CSS code for the simulation modules of the [Visual Chemical Engineering Project](http://visualchemeng.com).

The vce project aims to deliver chemical engineering principles in a way that sticks. We place you in control of common unit operations with dynamic, graphics-driven feedback. Under the bonnet, vce is powered by years of chemical engineering knowledge, brought to you through the power of [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and [Plotly](https://plot.ly/).
