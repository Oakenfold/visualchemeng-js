# About
The vce project aims to deliver chemical engineering principles in a way that sticks. We place you in control of common unit operations with dynamic, graphics-driven feedback. Under the bonnet, vce is powered by years of chemical engineering knowledge, brought to you through the power of p5.js and Plotly.
