# Boundary builder

This tool can be used to place vce_boundary.Boundary objects using the
mouse and keys (as opposed to adjusting the coordinates through trial
and error). Images can be imported and displayed on the canvas to aid
placement of the boundaries. Existing boundaries lists can be imported
from file.

Note to user: this tool is quite primitive at the moment. Furthermore,
it has only been tested locally (without a web server).
